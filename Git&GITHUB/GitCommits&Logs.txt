pwd --> This command shows the "Present Working Directory".

always run git status first. If git is initialize, I will always and always be on some branch. It may be master branch or other branch main, checkout etc.
 I have a plugin called "git lens" for commit graphs

 Now, 
 1. I made two file inside "gitone" folder named testonw.txt and testtwo.txt. So, for now ,from the flow of git written in "Git&github.txt" file, it is still in "working stage".
 2. Next step was "git add". So, let's say I want to track testone and not testtwo because testtwo is not ready to be tracked (according to me let's say)
 3. git add testone.txt
 4. run "git status" to see the status, which will be testone.txt in "staging area". "staging area" is a initermediate stage before any commit. It's like a video game asking "do you really want to save your changes?". I can stage and unstage the files as well.

 5. next step was "git commit -m `message`". commit always needs a message on why this is the zone, or why commiting this file, or what this file does. Here, I choose "Add file one" message.

6. We are now in the repo stage


// Now , i'll be doing the same thing but with the testtwo.txt file.
