Atomic commits  -----> The following is way for writing the commits as per industry standards 

1. kepp commits centric to one feature , one component or one fix. Focused on one thing.
2. Present or PAST commit message:
    * Depends {present tense, imperative}
    * give order to code base
    * don't care

note: git config --global(changes default editor to vscode)   core.editor  "code --wait".
