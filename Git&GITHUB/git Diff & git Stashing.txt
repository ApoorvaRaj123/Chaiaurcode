Git Diff -----> (informative command)
It compare working with staging. It shows the differences, but not between the file a and file b. It instead shows the differences between
the files a and a .i.e same file. The only difference is it shows me version of the file in some x time and some y time.

What I understood from this is, it meant that let's say I am working on file "a" and I have "staged" some changes. Now I want to compare the file 
when things were not staged vs when they are staged.
Maybe the comparison is "how does this exact same file looked like when I committed it/ two commits before" OR
Maybe the comparison is "how does this exact same file looked like in this branch vs in other branch"


How to read diff? It talks using some symbols which has some meanings like:
* let's say "a" is the name given to the file 1 and "b" is the name of the same file but after some time (i.e some changes as mentioned above)

1. ----- So in the diff, "---" is the symbol for "a", and "+++" is the symbol for "b"
2. change in lines and a little preview of it.


-------------------------------- Git Stash --------------------------------

Git stash is a sub tool in the git itself.

-> create a repo, work and commit on main
-> switch to another branch and work
-> conflicting changes do not allow to change the branch, without commiting
