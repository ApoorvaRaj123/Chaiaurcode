

First I'll be making some webpages ( very simplistic ) -----> index.html, about.html and contact.html

Now, I created a new filfe named "server.js" in which I will be wrting my server.

I used three modules for it. "http" , "fs" and "path"

http, for actually creating the server itself. It is a very big module in node that comes with a lot of functionalities and making a server is one of them.

fs, for handling the files and,

path, to get the file path.



For listening the requests from the browser that server can react upon after listening, there is no functionalities for it in the Java Script.

The truly responsible for it is "LibUV". Is is for binding all that request and giving me an object of request, so I can do whatever with that.
