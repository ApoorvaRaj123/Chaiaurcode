CRUD -> Create, Read, Update, Delete an entry.

types of DB -> SQL and NO-SQL and others like graph DB, vector DB    NO-SQL(not only SQL)


For it, the knowledge of backend is necessary. The whole job of backend is to process the data, then after processing the data,
talk to Databse (i.e add things to DB or get things from it and show it to the user etc).

The type of NO-SQL DB I studied is mongoDB. As SQl DB requires me to have basics of sql knowledge, and then I can use something like postgres,
MYSQL, but all of them requires some level of knowledge of SQL

But, in MongoDB, everything is an object. since, I am a Javascript developer , I feel very comfortable with it.

ex - {
    name: "goku"
}

and then we have ORMs. So what actually happens in the real world is let's just say if this is my MongoDB, I don't interact with it directly.
There is usually a layer between the backend and the database. So, backend talks to this layer, then that layer talks to the database. This layer is
called ORM (object relational manager. example ---> mongoose, Prisma, Drizzle)

I will be learining mongoose. It's job is to make talking to database very easy
