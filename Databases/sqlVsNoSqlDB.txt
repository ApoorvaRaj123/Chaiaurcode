SQL - structured query language.
It is not as complex as the regular programming language but it's domain specific, which means it is used to talk to the Data base.
It is specifically designed to use for modifying the Databse or schema or creating it. 

Schema means structure for structured Database

what is structured data?
Just like excel sheets there is a structure in it. I know exactly where , what will be going.

Relational database : RDBMS store data data within rows and columns which are used to form tables. A relation between the two table
can be formed using FOREIGN KEY. These keys are unique identifiers


what is unstructured Data? -> It is a data which doesn't have any predefined model for it. data such as social media posts are unstructured and can be
updated and changed rapidly, while structured data like bank transactions have a much lower rate of change.
ex => pictures, audio files, maps and videos.



What is NOSQL - not only syructured query language is a database management system used to ingest, store and retrieve unstructured data and semi-structured
data within a database.The reason they are called nosql is to emphasize the fact that these databases can handle non-tabular, non-relational data in
their original form
