I am using the Eraser application on browser to design the DB's.

First thing I am designing is the TODO application Database.

In the entity relation diagram the first entity I am going to have is "todos" itself.

other entity will be users and subtodos


for todos ------> 


todos {
    _id string pk    -----------> (pk = primary key)
    content string
    complete boolean
    subtodos ObjectId[] subtodos  -------> (here objectId is an array of ID's and it is referenced to subtodos)
    createdBy objectId users
    createdAt Date
    updatedAt Date
}

for users ------>


users {
    _id string pk
    username string
    email string
    password string
}



for subtodos ------>


subtodos {
    _id string pk
    content string
    complete boolean
    createdBy objectId users
    createdAt Date
    updatedAt Date
}





Now, I am going to map the relations between these entities.

So, I'll be having todos, and inside each todos I will be having subtodos (as defined in the schema above).

( i ). So, this subtodos inside the todos will be ahving a one to many relationship with the subtodos's id (Defined inside the subtodos schema above)

"<" is the symbol of "one to many" relationship in eraser application.
The overall meaning here is : The todos is one but inside each todo there are going to be many subtasks (subtodos). And each subtodos are referenced
through their id's.

In eraser application : todos.subtodos < subtodos._id


( ii ). do the same thing with createdBy inside todos schema and map it "one to one" with users's id
( iii ). do the same thing with createdBy inside subtodos schema and map it "one to one" with users's id
