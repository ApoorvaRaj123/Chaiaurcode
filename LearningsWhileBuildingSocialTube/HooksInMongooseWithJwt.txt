Mongoose have some hooks.
These are middlewares which runs before someting happens.

They are useful for writing the plugins. 

Mongoose provide me with prehooks and posthooks.

prehooks for any operation just before saving into the database and posthooks for any operation just after saving into the database.

Now, generally I write the functionality in the controllers folder but somw functionality are so attached to some models that seperating these 
functionality in different folders from models.

One such case is what I am going to write in user model. So, for the user the one thing that I will do every single time before storing the USER 
is that I will encrypt the password given by the user to secure the password.

To encrypt the password I can use the "encrypt" module in built in NODE or I can use "bcrypt" package
