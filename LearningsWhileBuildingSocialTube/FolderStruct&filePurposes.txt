1. The very first steps to create a new project is to initialize it using "npm init"

2. after that, I installed two dev dependencies : nodemon and prettier. Nodemon for restarting the servers and prettier for linting the code
in a proper way. (This is useful in professional environments)

3.In package.json, I defined the "type": "module" so that I can use modern JS import syntax. I prefer it that way.

4. I made two files named : .prettierrc, which is a RC type file and .prettierignore where I wrote the folders and file names for the prettier to
ignore them completely.

5. I made a "src" directory and in that I made these folders : controllers, db, routes, middlewares, models and utils. This way of seperating the 
folders concerning different purposes is called "seperation of concerns" and this folder structure is called "Model View Controller" or MVC structure.

6. Inside the same "src" directory, I made these files as well : .env, index.js, app.js, constants.js and readme.md .

7. Inside "src/db" I made a file named index.js whose only purpose is to make a connection with database. 

8. I went inside the "src/models" folder and made these files : comment.models.js, like.models.js, playlists.models.js, subscription.models.js,
tweet.models.js, user.models.js, video.models.js.
This folder only contains the files that are just mongoose syntax of data modelling that I did on eraser. It contains files of each entity in that DB design.
Also, in each file name, the ".models" has no special effect at all. It's just a naming convention for the models which I can choose not to do. That's all.

9. I will be creating similar files inside rhe "controllers" folder as well, as each model will be having it's own Controller as well.
But before this, I installed express and mongoose through npm
