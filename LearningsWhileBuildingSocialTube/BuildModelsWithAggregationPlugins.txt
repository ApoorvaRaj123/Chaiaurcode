I will be writing all the models of the application that I am building in this page.

I will first be working on the user model.

This is the needed fields for it that I decided : 

{
id string pk
username string
fullname string
email string
avatar string
coverImage string
watchHistory ObjectId[] videos
password string
refreshToken string
createdAt Date
updatedAt Date
}


Now, My first step will always going to be importing the mongoose, and { Schema } (yes,I destructured it) from "mongoose".

now in new Schema, which is a method, I will write different objects like numbers. But before actually writing the schema, I will export it as a document 
like : 
export const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema); -----> This line means that I am telling mongoose to go create a document named "User" inside my database
and this model will be using the schema (structure) based on "userSchema".
I am exporting this with the name of User for the case of needing this to import somewhere. I will not only get the model but I will also get the features
that come with it like querying the database, finding a user, saving a new element in the DB


Now, I will define my userschema. Also, I won't need to add the id myself because MongoDB automatically adds it and handles the primary key part as well.
