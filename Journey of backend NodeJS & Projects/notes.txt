What are severs? Server is a software which serves you , it's not those big hardwares , they are data centers. Server is installed inside them.

The idea is that frontend sends a request to the server from a specific port and the server sends the response from that exact same port back to the browser.
That's the whole goal.

How do we do that? Most of the time I will have to ahead and create an API or also known as Application Programming Interface.

This is what we create in the server so that any applpication that comes up can consume the APIs.
Until now I only knew how to consume the APIs.
But In the server we will create APIs so that any request/different types of request that comes up, I can send the data based on the request type.

I can process their data, store the data in the database and maybe read some data from the database.
